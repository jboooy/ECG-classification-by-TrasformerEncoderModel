# ECG-classification-by-TrasformerEncoderModel

This is a problem of classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) sequence data into five different classes. The model was primarily designed using the encoder component of a transformer.

While successfully achieving high classification accuracy, the predictive accuracy for classes with fewer instances is compromised due to significant imbalances within the dataset.
